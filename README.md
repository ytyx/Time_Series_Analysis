**Objective**: Renewable energy remains one of the most important topics for a sustainable future.
Wind, being a perennial source of power, could be utilized to satisfy our power
requirements. With the rise of wind farms, wind power forecasting would prove to be
quite helpful.

**Windmill Data**: It contains various weather, turbine, and rotor features. Data has been recorded from January 2018 till March 2020. Readings have
been recorded at 10-minute intervals. The aim was to predict the mean daily wind power that could be generated from the windmill for the next 15 days.

**Goal**: To train a final model to produce a forecast on the mean daily wind power that could be generated from the windmill for the next 15
days. The target variable indicating the wind power is the column ‘ActivePower’ in the training set. The prediction accuracy will be measured using RMSE.

**Model Used**: ETS, Theta, and Prophet.
